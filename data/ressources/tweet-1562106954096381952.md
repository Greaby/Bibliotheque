AI fashion show using dall-e to generate hundreds of outfits of the day after tomorrow. An interesting way to brainstorm costume and fashion design ideas. Collab with

Some of the fits that didn’t make the cut
Used
@runwayml
to help roto all these dall e outfits
"Let's hear it for the vague blur!" -
How many frames is this, if i may?
Exported at 6 frames per second. It’s almost 100 dall-e outfits. Using two outfits per frame then slowed back down to 24 fps. Probably generated a couple hundred other outfits not seen here
Always said fashion needed more floating orbs
This is breathtaking.
